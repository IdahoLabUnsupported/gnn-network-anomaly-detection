# gnn-network-anomaly-detection
The purpose of this code is to use Machine Learning to spot unusual patterns in network traffic, which could indicate malicious activity. It does this by applying a Graph Neural Network that builds a graph-based view of the network logs and detects anomalies within the local graph context.
